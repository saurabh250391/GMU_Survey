This is a Thankyou page, It is mapped against a string value in the jsf config file.
whenever any user submits a survey form and the calculated value of the raffle (10 number entered by them
in the raffle field) is less tahn 90, then they will see this page. This page is just thanking user
for filling the survey form.
